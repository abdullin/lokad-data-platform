It is based on concepts from Lokad.CQRS, Lokad.Cloud and EventStore.\r\n\r\nSome introductory information:\r\n\r\n* [Introducing Data Platform](http://abdullin.com/journal/2012/10/20/introducing-lokad-data-platform.html)\r\n* [Scalability targets of Data Platform](http://abdullin.com/journal/2012/10/20/scalability-targets-of-lokad-data-platform.html)\r\n\r\nMore documentation will be available, once we push through first production deployments internally.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThanks to the authors and maintainers of these projects for letting us stand on the shoulders of giants:\r\n\r\n* [EventStore](http://geteventstore.com)\r\n* [Service Stack](http://www.servicestack.net/) (and especially authors of async branch)\r\n* [NLog](http://nlog-project.org/)\r\n* [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/)\r\n\r\nSamples\r\n-------\r\n\r\n1. [Sample 1] (https://github.com/Lokad/lokad-data-platform/tree/master/SmartApp.Sample2.Continuous) - Sequential read event stream and shows \"Next offset\"\r\n2. [Sample 2] (https://github.com/Lokad/lokad-data-platform/tree/master/SmartApp.Sample2.Continuous) - Show distribution of event by size\r\n3. [Sample 3] (https://github.com/Lokad/lokad-data-platform/tree/master/SmartApp.Sample3.WebUI) - Show aggregated data from event steam.","name":"Lokad Data Platform Sample"}
