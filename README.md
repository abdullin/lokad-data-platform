Lokad Data Platform Sample
==========================

This is Data Platform sample from Lokad - showing principles of storing and processing large (GBytes and TBytes) data streams in the cloud. It is based on concepts from Lokad.CQRS, Lokad.Cloud and EventStore.

Some introductory information:

* [Introducing Data Platform](http://abdullin.com/journal/2012/10/20/introducing-lokad-data-platform.html)
* [Scalability targets of Data Platform](http://abdullin.com/journal/2012/10/20/scalability-targets-of-lokad-data-platform.html)

More documentation will be available, once we push through first production deployments internally.
